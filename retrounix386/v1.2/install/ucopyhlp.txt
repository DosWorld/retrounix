Assembling:

masm unixcopy.asm
link /t unixcopy

Working Directory: RUNIX2
1.44MB Floppy Disk Image: FD0.IMG
Bootfile: BOOT5.BIN (dos), boot (runix)
Kernel: RUNIX2.BIN (dos), unix (runix)

All files must be in working (dos) directory...
(Accept it as RUNIX2, here)

*** 

Start UNIXCOPY program with FD image by using..
C:\RUNIX2> unixcopy -i fd0.img

(or you can directly use 1.44MB flopy drive -A: or B:- by using 
C:\RUNIX2> unixcopy fd0 .. unixcopy fd1, unixcopy a:, unixcopy b:)

then..

use '?' command for command help. (in UNIXCOPY)

ls -l . ; list root dir contents..

***

At first, copy boot file to root directory..
(its name must be 'boot')

fromdos boot5.bin boot

..then set 'boot' file as startup file (as boot file)

bootfile boot

..then.. copy runix (v2) kernel file as unix (in root directory)

fromdos runix2.bin unix

...

(Other files are copied from dos as above 'fromdos' command samples..)

'chdir' command may be used to change runix working directory..

For example: chdir bin

Other UNIXCOPY commands: dir, ls, todos, rm, mkdir, rmdir, link, exit,
show, inode, chmod, chown, chgrp, namei, fs, volume, nobootfile, help.

...

Finally, this fd image is ready to test, Retro UNIX 386 v2 OS project works.
