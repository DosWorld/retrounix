You can assemble Retro UNIX 386 v2
source code by using NASM (v2.14)...

((unix386.s is the main source file, 
includes other source files
via %include directive))

Example:
nasm unix386.s -l unix386.txt -o unix

(For above example, all of Retro UNIX 386
v2 kernel --".s"-- source files must be
in the nasm program directory...
But, you can use another directory or
you can copy files between nasm directory
and your working directory; for axample, 
you can use 'runix' directory as working dir.)

(Read NASM manual for details...)

******

Then you can copy 'unix' binary/kernel to
root directory of the Retro UNIX 386 FS
floppy disk...

by using 'UNIXHDCP.COM' program

Example:
fromdos c:\nasm\unix /unix

******

In order to install RUNIX (Retro UNIX)
386 v2 file system on a hard disk image:
(HD0.IMG is a sample hd image file name)

Create HD0.IMG file by using HDIMAGE.COM
Create Runix v2 (71h) partition by using HDIMAGE.COM
(Follow partition creating menu after selecting disk geometry.) 

sample disk geometry
--------------------
Cylinders: 400
Heads:      16
Sectors:    17

('sectors' may be 63.. max. runix v2 partition size may be upto 512MB. 
Image file size may be up to 1GB.. And dos and runix partition
may be created on it by using HDIMAGE.COM)

Note: To use 2GB hd image is possible but runix partition creating
on it gives error.. 
Also, >512MB runix partitions gives error with UNIXHDCP.COM.
(for current versions of HDIMAGE.COM, UNIXHDFS.COM, UNIXHDCP.COM progs.)

****

Then, format RUNIX (71h) partition by using UNIXHDFS.COM program.

****

NOTE: It is possible to use a real hard disk if a RUNIX v2 (71h) partition
is already created on it. UNIXHDFS.COM can format 71h (RUNIX v2) partition
and UNIXHDCP.COM can be used to copy boot, kernel and program files 
to the RUNIX v2 file system on hard disk.
